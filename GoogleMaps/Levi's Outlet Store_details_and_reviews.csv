akif syed,5,I went to check out if there were any discounts for the Eid season.  And I was duly rewarded.  One of the sales persons (Mr Badar) was so very courteous and helpful that I actually offered him a job.  But he is in his first year of university ( electrical and computer engineering) and was just doing this part time. Got two pairs of jeans and three shirts.  The next day I went again and bought stuff for my son. Good quality at good prices.,2 years ago,Levi's Outlet Store,"awami trade center karachi company, Awami trade center، basement Rohtas Rd, G-9 Markaz G 9 Markaz G-9, Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory, Pakistan",(051) 2285185,https://www.levi.com/global,"Monday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Tuesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Wednesday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Thursday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Friday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Saturday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM, Sunday: 10:00 AM – 10:00 PM"
