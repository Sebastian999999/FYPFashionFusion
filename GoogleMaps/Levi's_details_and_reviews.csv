Maryam Chaudry,1,"Levi's is my all time favourite brand in terms of the products but today I experienced the worst ever customer service from their staff(GIGA mall outlet)...

Not only my family, they were making fun of every customer entering their shop, they didn't bothered to give any concern toward the age.. I literally saw their boy making bad faces behind an old lady who was checking jacket for her son.

Their concerned authorities should check the CCTV cameras so that the salesman can know their limits.. Being a member of a costly brand doesn't allow you to make fun of people who walk away after seeing price tags...",10 months ago,Levi's,"Giga Mall WTC, G5C5+C7G, Sector F DHA Phase II, Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory, Pakistan",(051) 2725529,N/A,"Monday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Tuesday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Wednesday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Thursday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Friday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Saturday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM, Sunday: 11:00 AM – 11:00 PM"
