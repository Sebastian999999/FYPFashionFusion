nasriquesz mohd,4,"I was here for Chaco hiking sandals. Two female staffs were very helpful, advising the right fit and showing sale items. One of them even helped to stitch the strap. I had a good experience here. Wish that the shop open earlier in the morning instead of 12pm. I hope someday CCOO will open a branch in Malaysia as well",2 months ago,Campers' Corner Outdoor Outfitters,"75 Bukit Timah Rd, #01-01 Boon Siew Building, Singapore 229833",6337 4743,http://camperscorner.com.sg/,"Monday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Tuesday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Wednesday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Thursday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Friday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Saturday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Sunday: Closed"
Jian C,5,"Got great climbing shoes and climbing harnesses here; super convenient to try on both. They were really helpful in advising on sizing and different climbing shoe and harness types/needs etc. And they have a fantastic setup that allows you to actually try out the weight bearing qualities of their selection of climbing harness - you can sit in them while suspended to see how comfortable the fit is, which is super important. You can’t really know how you’re going to like a harness until you’re actually hanging in one to see how the shape and fit cuts into your body and molds to it/your weight. This shop also has a better selection of overall outdoor goods and equipment, more diverse than most of the other shops I’ve been to in SH",9 months ago,Campers' Corner Outdoor Outfitters,"75 Bukit Timah Rd, #01-01 Boon Siew Building, Singapore 229833",6337 4743,http://camperscorner.com.sg/,"Monday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Tuesday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Wednesday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Thursday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Friday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Saturday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Sunday: Closed"
cindy khrime,5,"I went to a few shops looking for good hiking shoes and as nothing matched my needs, I was advised to visit Camper's Corner. What an incredible place. Lam may have changed my life with making me realize i've been using wrong sized hiking shoes for years! We spent a good hour, and despite my resistance, him and few others patiently worked with me to make the right choice. Same for the others that helped me chose the right fit pants, and to top it all off, the super welcoming owner Kelvin rounded off the experience with a chilled beer, great conversation and sharing of experiences with another cool older couple that had ended up in this lovely shop the same as I did.
This is how experiences should be. We love the outdoors and sharing experiences with like minded people. To find such a vibe in Singapore was the perfect ending before I left the country.

Thank you all at Campers Corner.",a month ago,Campers' Corner Outdoor Outfitters,"75 Bukit Timah Rd, #01-01 Boon Siew Building, Singapore 229833",6337 4743,http://camperscorner.com.sg/,"Monday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Tuesday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Wednesday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Thursday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Friday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Saturday: 12:00 – 8:00 PM, Sunday: Closed"
