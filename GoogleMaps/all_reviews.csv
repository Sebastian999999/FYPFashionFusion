I especially like their plants in the building. It creates an amazing atmosphere on the building giving positive vibes. Their clothes are also quite affordable and of top quality. I have visited many outlets of Khaadi with my family and I have always been impressed with the plants and the building architecture. Hope they always manage real plants and don't go for fake plants like many others.,9 months ago

In the '80s the only store that I knew existed was in Pookadai. I used to buy honey in thick glass bottles(not presentable). There was then a reputation that Khadi honey is pure and harvested from farmers. In the next years, after the '90s, I could not buy from Khadi as I live in Singapore. However in my recent trip last week, after trying many different brands of honey, I decided to buy again from Khadi hoping that they live up to the past reputation of selling pure honey.
I was amazed that they had such a vast variety of products, and homegrown groceries too!
I wish them success and hope they continue to expand nearer to the consumer.",a month ago

I have visited their self service  Supermarket. Great quality products starting from organic snacks to provisional items to soaps to Nilgiris ucliptus tea  , natural honey, oththukuli ghee..wow lots of great quality products & varities which we can't miss out. Majority doesn't know this place because of show room appeal. Show room looks like 19th century place. Not sure why nobody putting effort to improve this aesthetically.
Coming to billing, typical government staffs & demotivated employees. Only one counter and there is a big queue. After billing, you have to step out for cashier (luckily , fortunately, they are accepting cards) then you have to show the slip to delivery counter to collect your items.
They could have brought several items into Online selling to avoid this crowd. Also, they should provide contactless payment like UPI bar code etc which is now a days street side vendor is doing..
Very importantly, govt should encourage all employees to buy home stuffs from here by providing coupons, gift card etc. This way, all these kadhi bhavan can become more profitable and make touch completion against all private players.
Most importantly, put young energetic staffs atleast in Supermarket/cashier section to appease customers. Current staffs still think they are the customers and we are the devotees . This attitude should change.
Considering the product quality & supporting our  own farmers & weavers , request to purchase here more often though we have above constraints..",2 years ago

The protector costs $75.90 for a phablet.

Bought and applied on 28 July 2022 (Thursday). Entire process is around an hour. Due to the application issues, there was a scratch on the screen protector. Resend on 29 July 2022 (Friday) for re-application. The entire process took over an hour.

During the second application, the staff handed back the phone to me for check, for which I assumed that the job was completed. After seeing some poor finishing, he than mentioned he was just showing me the phone to check. I was like “check what” if it was not completed. Why don’t you complete the job before letting me check the finishing?

After the second completion, still not satisfied with the application, I asked him if this was how the product is supposed to look after it is completed. He mentioned yes. After debating for a few rounds, he told me to go and write a Google review if I am still not satisfied. I was like wow, great way to speak to your customers. I said thank you and left. For clarity, I left because the staff told me that the application of the screen protector is as good as it gets so.

For your information, pictures were taken on 30 July 2022 (1 day after application). I let the pictures do the talking, cause for the price, expected the finishing to be much better. If this was $10 or $20, I can close one eye. But $75.90 for a screen protector is pricey and IMO, I expected a lot more.

Also, these pictures were taken one day after, so you can imagine how well the protectors hold.

I do see their staff genuinely trying to help, doing their best to rectify the issues, could have been a tad bit more apologetic though. But fundamentally speaking, I think that there is a product flaw as the protector does not apply smoothly across all the surfaces. This could be due to the phone curves edge but in this case, don’t sell for this model. If you are going to charge $75.90, the customer is going to expect more for the product.

The $10 lifetime warranty is not useful too. If the product is fundamentally flawed, no point giving lifetime warranty as it does not solve the product issue in the first place.

Your phone is also going to be very hot after application as they use a heat dryer for application.

Overall, not too great an experience, but guess this is as good as it is going to get. Almost 3 hours and $75.90 loss, let my loss be your gain. Customer service also does not make up for the entire experience. Skip the product, just go somewhere else.

2 out of 5 starts and do not recommend.

I'm not sure if it's a product or skill issue. I paid 75 for a fusion screen protector for my iPad Pro, and waited for almost an hour, with 2 attempts made to apply the film on my device.

When it was done, I asked if the wipe marks would go off. The person said yes, in a few hours, which I thought was fine and not uncommon anyway. And, I walked around the mall, went for my lunch and during my lunch, whipped out my iPad to see what was shown in the photo. It's not even wipe marks anymore, just bubbles. I mean, even film on my Samsung phone from other shop isn't of this quality.

This was when out of curiosity, I googled and read many of the similar poor reviews. I didn't even bother with the lifetime warranty anymore because I thought this film wasn't suitable for scribbling with an apple pencil too. So, I went ahead to iStudio on the 2nd level to change to tempered glass. That's of course, another hefty sum, but at least, worth spending as compared to this.",3 months ago

And most importantly I noticed the protector itself is very sensitive to water, there is once my hand is slightly watery due to rain and one of the corner of the protector just fall off immediately after I touches my phone. At the end I have to 'repair' them myself by slowly pushing it back. So theoretically now my phone is splashproof, but my phone protector is not, lol. And they never mentioned this when I purchase at their counter

According to their life time warranty policy, I will have to pay $10 each time if I need to go back and ask them to readjust the protector. As a consumer I don't think it worth the money consider I only used it for less than 3 months.

Overall I think it is a good solution, the material is really good and tough like they declared, just it has some problems to resolve before you can put it into daily usage,

1. The protector is so easy to fall off from the edges since your hand touches it everyday
2. It is too sensitive to water

Hope they can come out something that can resolve the 2 issues mentioned above, and before that, I think you should consider other protector option in the market",a year ago
